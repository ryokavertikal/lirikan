### Burning hearts - Seabirds (Lyrics)

What a mild and tempting breeze..
Above a calm and sleeping sea..
With strong arms we swam out to the island..
Not anyone knows we were that close.. </br>

Egretta garzetta..
Egretta garzetta..
Somateria spectabilis..
Somateria spectabilis.. </br>

Only sea birds can make..
Such a sound..
That waves will carry around..
For thousands and thousands..
Of nautical miles..
We heard their beak..
Talk all through the night.. </br>

Egretta garzetta..
Egretta garzetta..
Somateria spectabilis..
Somateria spectabilis..
Egretta garzetta..
Egretta garzetta..
Somateria mollissima.. </br>
