### aesthetic across color line - 1 </br>

So awkward..
Legend of failure..
Climbing on the walls..
To rip myself away..
From all this moments that you laughs..
Which don't belong to me now anyway..
I fucked up again.. </br>

So I get closure..
To say myself I get it..
The conscious speaks to me..
I'll better nap away this morning till evening..
And feeling fine..
With all this songs I singalong..
THE SONGS I SING ALONG.. </br>

and the bongs I hit alone </br>

Maybe after a few drinks I'll start to think about it..
Over and over again..
Well I guess I'm fucked now..
Shall I salute every stranger..
Which pass me by?..
With a breath of garlic.. </br>

No, I'm not </br>

so I fell down alone thinking about the rest that I have to end and start to work out all those plans which one day felt so bright but they don't make sense now
a blanket full of problems that we shared is washed away
and now so fresh like my new nikes
this thoughts annoy me and I close my eyes to think again but fall asleep
before my cat reacts

it never felt so B U M M E R </br>


### aesthetic across color line - 3

Every time..
I close my eyes..
I see your face and how you blink..
I guess it can became for me a reason..
But my stomach feels so weird.. </br>

Am I awake for dreaming?..
Well I just tweaked myself twice..
Why am I afraid of leaving?..
Guess who just believed in us.. </br>

If we were a pirates..
Of salty seas..
I'd found you an island..
If your dreams.. </br>

For you and me </br>

For you and me </br>

You made me..
So happy..
And now I will try..
To fly high like I've never imagined..
Only if you will shine..
Bright..
When you sitting next to me..
I feel alive.. </br>

### aesthetic across color line - 4

I love myself with you..
I live my life for you..
I love you and I hate you.. </br>
