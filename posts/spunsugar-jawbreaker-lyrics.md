### Spunsugar - Jawbreaker Lyrics

I am ready now..
They seem happy to be melting..
All under someone's reign..

Hold it steady now..
I'll point where you should be aiming..
It's all worth the pain..
Doubting becomes that itch in your gums..
A sudden need to bite..
Your blood and teeth..
Get mixed with the sweet..
And it all turns into spite..
A rock of solid sugar..

I can follow him..
With his eyes like a coyote..
That can conjure an earthquake..

I will challenge them..
Do everything he told me..
Turn their crosses into snakes..

Doubting becomes that itch in your gums..
A sudden need to bite..
Your blood and teeth..
Get mixed with the sweet..
And it all turns into spite..
A rock of solid sugar..

Twenty nine..
All is mine..
Neon sign..
Stars align..
