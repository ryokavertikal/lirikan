### Tallies - No Dreams of Fayres (Lyrics)

Scrunched up time, crashes deep..
It fills my mind, with aches and needs...
Can’t step outside, my sky’s incomplete...
I’ll live right here, between...
The duvet and the top sheet... </br>

I don’t want to wake up, I just want to lay back down..
I know, it’s not the way I planned it...
I don’t want to need you, I just want to stay face down...
I know, it’s not the way I planned it... </br>

No counting sheep, no dreams of fayres..
Light bending sheens, on braids of hair..
Shapes of wheels, with grooves so deep...
Myself just feels, unknown..
I’m laying here breathing.. </br>

I don’t want to wake up, I just want to lay back down..
I know, it’s not the way I planned it..
I don’t want to need you. I just want to stay face down..
I know, it’s not the way I planned it... </br>

If I’m just here unused, will I lose track of my time...
So simple just to move, I know, it’s not the way I need it... </br>

I don’t want to wake up, I just want to lay back down...
I know, it’s not the way I planned it...
I don’t want to need you, I just want to stay face down...
I know, it’s not the way I planned it.. </br>

If I’m just here unused.
So simple just to move. I know, it’s not the way I planned it.. </br>
