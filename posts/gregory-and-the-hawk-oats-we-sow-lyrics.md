### Gregory and The Hawk - Oats we sow (Lyrics)

Someday I'll toss all your presents..
And bury the letters left unsent..
Cause it's bad to do what's easy..
Just cause it's easy..

And I wanna do what pleases me but I can't..
And the road, she'd roll round the side of the mountain..
With nowhere to go..

But the heart, we know..
When it's a-loving it's a-leaning toward being alone..

Someday I'll find the mind to mend it..
And make dry these eyes I've gotten wet..
Cause it's bad to do what's easy just cause it's easy..
And I wanna do what pleases me but I can't, oh no..
And the crow, he'd mow half the grass on the knoll..
With nowhere to go..

But the heart, we know..
When it's a-needing it's careening toward being alone..

The oats we sow..
They could seed on forever with nowhere to grow..
But the heart, we know..
When it's asking its exact twin it will not be alone..
